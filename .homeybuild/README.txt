This app monitors your iopool pool in Homey. It retrieves temperature, pH, ORP, recommended filtration duration and pool mode, so you can use these values in Homey flows. Setup requires an iopool API key and the pool identifier. The app adds a device for your pool and updates measurements at a user-defined interval. Use the flow action to fetch the recommended filtration duration for pump scheduling. For support, bugs and source code, see the links on the app page.
